I was aware that Hexadecimal was a thing, and it was used for colour things on things, and binary was also useful for something but it turns out that converting from Hexadecimal to Binary is a lot easier than it seemed!

One thing to note is that Hexadecimal is Base 16, and Binary is Base 2, so therefore every four digits in binary is one digit in hexadecimal. Still not convinced? Try it yourself!

There's not really much to comment on how well I learnt in that lesson, so this’ll be quite short…
