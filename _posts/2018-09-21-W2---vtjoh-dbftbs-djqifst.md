Here's how it went in a few quotes.

"WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO!?"
“HOW DID YOU TYPE THE ALPHABETS SO QUICKLY?”
"WHAT'S THAT THING WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ADD???"

I was aware that Spreadsheets and Excel had the ability to code stuff in them, but what I didn't realise was how painful they were to code. It started off pretty simple: you had your "concatenate" command, which - well - concatenated stuff of your choice. Then “vlookup” was introduced, among with other functions of Spreadsheets.

Solving a Caesar Cipher (yes I am doing it the American way) isn't that hard, assuming you know what you’re doing. However in this lesson I realised that - it isn’t actually that easy to make it. However with perseverance and a bit of independence, I think I did pretty well for our first lesson on Cryptography in Google Sheets.

I think my biggest error was the fact that (a) I didn't properly read the helpful descriptions that Sheets provided, however skim-read it, and (b) didn’t go further by taking-to-the-web (the thing right in front of me) which is practically an interactive encyclopedia. Next time I should aim to take a step back, and think - if and when it’s not going exactly well - 'what have I not done that will very likely help me progress?’. This hopefully means I will bounce back better by being brilliant-er.

In <a href="megmefalrez.github.io/about">my about section</a>, you can find the Caesar Cypher Spreadsheet which doesn't show most of the working behind it but some of it. I’ll also try implement other cyphers or codes, like ASCII (American something something) or the Vigenère cypher.
