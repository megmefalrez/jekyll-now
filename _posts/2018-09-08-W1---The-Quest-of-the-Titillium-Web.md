Before you ask - Titillium does not mean perfect, nor does it mean peaceful, or anything like that. Actually, it's a font. I just thought it sounded cool, like the Goblet of Fire or something dramatic but then it turns out this Barty Jr. fellow was using a potion to look like someone else and that’s sort of the big twist of the book.

That doesn't mean implementing a font into a website which isn’t a generic and easy-access font (like Helvetica, or… the dreaded Comic Sans MS) would be anything but easy, as I found out on the 6th of September - a Thursday afternoon.

After given a quick briefing of what he - being Mr Keen - expected of us, along with our eternally-lasting (and haunting) dosage of horrible websites, my general plan was to make  my website space themed, as if you're on some sort of space station.

My first objective was to change the font of my new blog to Titillium Web. I thought it would take the rest of the lesson, given the fact that we had half an hour's worth of briefing.

It took me around 4 hours of messing around until I got it to do what I wanted it to do.

On a sidenote, I don't understand why the teachers tell us to delete our previous repository. Currently I actually have to put minimal effort in to make the background an image, doing the container jazz whereas I could’ve just copied it from my old blog code and done nothing!

When I did eventually implement the font into my blog (after asking for Mr Keen's help) I persevered to do a few other cool things: like making the background-image, but furthermore adjusting it to scale; or making the container around my text an image (which makes sense when you think about it, but there weren’t any bud light signs saying that we could do that).

Overall I think I've been growing my independence and perseverance over the last year or so, which has clearly benefited me to have the ability to make cooler things - like what the website (as of when I’m writing this) looks like. While I wasn’t particularly engaged at some times, mainly because I was sitting in front of a computer and upon blinking sometimes YouTube videos were on my screen out of nowhere; I think I could take a lesson with improving my website, by having a better mindset on what I want to do when I go somewhere to do something - instead of having a "general" idea of what I wanted to add onto my website, I think having a more precise set of details, and the mindset of: 'Ok, we’ll do this and this, and we’ll see how it goes’ would stop me from getting sidetracked as often.
