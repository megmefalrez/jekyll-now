What really (emphasis on really) boils my soil is the lack of user-friendly interfaces Github has. The objective of having blogs - from my POV - was to let us reflect on our lesson, as well as letting us expand on our coding skills, especially in CSS.

Problem is, that nobody did expand on skills which we weren't served. If we were told how to make a table, some people would - but very few actually did things which others hadn’t: and even then, they were about under an hour’s worth of progress.

However, with Mozilla Thimble I've actually understood what the hell I’m doing a lot better!

**Before**:

Thought a .container was a thing where you can contain things within things

**After**:

Made a .continent:first-child so that the first continent would be Eurasia, because the Motherland is there.

**Before**:

*crosses fingers* Hopes that blog doesn't break.

*ten seconds later* Blog breaks because forgot a semi-colon.

**After**:

Uses live preview so then realises the lack of a semi-colon.

**Before**:

Website looks a bit uckers

**After**:Website does no longer look uckers (however I haven't yet made posts there (or even made links))

Point is: Thimble is gud.
