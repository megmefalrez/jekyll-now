The point of a disco - from my opinion - is to-

Actually first, let's just set the vibe..

Ok, good! Where was I? Oh yeah: the point of a disco, from my opinion, is to get as much profit as you POSSIBLY can. Buy everything budget, and reap the rewards.

Let's just put that rule to the test, so you understand what to do if you want to make profit by a disco.

**Question 1**: which DJ should you hire?

A: The one everyone likes, regardless of cost

B: A really cheap one

C: What do you mean by "DJ"? They're not profitable!

**Question 2**: how much should you sell your tickets?

A: Make them free! People can donate if they wish.

B: Like, £10?

C: Enough so you get 250% profit

**Question 3**: how do you calculate how much profit you get from this disco?

A: Hire someone to do it for you!

B: Pshh, I'm sure it’s fine!

C: Google Spreadsheets, of course!

**Answers**:

Give yourself 1 point for each time you answered B, and give yourself 2 points for each time you answered C. Take away 1 point if you answered A for any of them.

How did you do?

**-3 to 0**: oof. You clearly aren't in the right mindeset.

**1 to 4**: ehh, ok. You could do a little better.

**5 to 6**: that's the spirit!

Of course, when you need to calculate profits you HAVE to use Excel or Spreadsheets: it's not that hard, and you can customise it without having to ask professionals to do it.

In the lesson, I think I did pretty well: I actually didn't get distracted for the first time in Computing this year, which is a big plus. What could I have done to improve? Well… except for being able to snap my fingers and there’s my work done, I don’t really think doing it faster would’ve helped that much. If anything, I would’ve been a bit more lazy, so I think the speed I worked at was completely fine.

In my about section, I've embedded the spreadsheet, but you can also click the link here if you want to make a copy and mess around with it (but please don’t copy it because that is not very family friendly).
